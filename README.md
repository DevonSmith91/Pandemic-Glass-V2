This is will be the website for Pandemic Glass. 

I will be expanding on the README as we go along while also creating an overall TODO list in here for future reference when coming across things I should take into account

TODOs:

- Look into finding a font/color scheme
- Look into Mixins if needed(typography.module.scss > Link sections commented out)
- Look into Accessability Focus
- Look into google analytics
